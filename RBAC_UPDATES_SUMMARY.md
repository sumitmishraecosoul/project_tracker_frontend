# RBAC Updates Summary - Backend Changes Complete ✅

## 🎯 **Overview**
All backend RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) changes have been implemented according to your requirements. Employees can now create, edit, and delete tasks with proper department-based restrictions.

## 🔧 **Backend Changes Implemented**

### **1. Routes Updated (`routes/tasks.js`)**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Only admin and manager could create/edit/delete tasks
router.post('/', auth, authorize(['admin', 'manager']), createTask);
router.put('/:id', auth, authorize(['admin', 'manager']), updateTask);
router.delete('/:id', auth, authorize(['admin', 'manager']), deleteTask);

// AFTER: All authenticated users can create/edit/delete tasks with RBAC checks
router.post('/', auth, createTask);
router.put('/:id', auth, updateTask);
router.delete('/:id', auth, deleteTask);
```

### **2. Task Creation Logic Updated (`controllers/taskController.js`)**
```javascript
// NEW RBAC RULES:
if (requesterRole === 'employee') {
  // Employee can only assign to users in their own department
  // Employee can only set reporter as themselves or users in their department
} else if (requesterRole === 'manager') {
  // Manager can only assign to users in their department
  // Manager can only set reporter as users in their department
}
// Admin can create tasks for anyone (no restrictions)
```

### **3. Task Update Logic Updated (`controllers/taskController.js`)**
```javascript
// NEW canEditTask FUNCTION:
if (user.role === 'employee') {
  // Employees can only edit/delete tasks assigned to them or created by them
  if (assignedId === userId || reporterId === userId) {
    return true;
  }
}
```

### **4. Task Reassignment Logic Updated**
```javascript
// EMPLOYEE: Can reassign to users in their department
// MANAGER: Can reassign to users in their department  
// ADMIN: Can reassign to anyone
```

## 🎯 **Frontend Requirements**

### **1. Project Detail Page - "Add New Task" Button**
The "Add New Task" button should now be visible for **ALL users** (admin, manager, employee) since the backend now allows employees to create tasks.

```javascript
// Update canCreateTask function
const canCreateTask = () => {
  // ALL users can create tasks now (admin, manager, employee)
  return true;
};
```

### **2. Task Edit/Delete Buttons**
```javascript
// Update canEditTask function
const canEditTask = (task) => {
  const user = getCurrentUser();
  
  if (user.role === 'admin') return true;
  
  if (user.role === 'manager') {
    // Manager can edit tasks in their department
    return task.department === user.department;
  }
  
  if (user.role === 'employee') {
    // Employee can edit tasks assigned to them or created by them
    return task.assignedTo === user.id || task.reporter === user.id;
  }
  
  return false;
};

// Update canDeleteTask function (same logic as canEditTask)
const canDeleteTask = (task) => {
  return canEditTask(task);
};
```

### **3. Task Creation Modal**
The task creation modal should now work for employees with these restrictions:
- **Assigned To**: Only show users from employee's department
- **Reporter**: Only show employee themselves and users from their department

```javascript
// Filter users for task creation
const getAvailableUsers = () => {
  const user = getCurrentUser();
  
  if (user.role === 'admin') {
    return allUsers; // All users
  }
  
  if (user.role === 'manager' || user.role === 'employee') {
    return allUsers.filter(u => u.department === user.department);
  }
  
  return [];
};
```
