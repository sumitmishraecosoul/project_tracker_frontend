# Frontend Department Filtering Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Overview**
Successfully implemented comprehensive department-based filtering and default department logic across all pages (Dashboard, Project Tracker, Task Tracker) to match the backend RBAC implementation.

## 🔧 **Key Features Implemented**

### **1. Default Department Logic**
- **Admin Users**: Default to their own department when they have one, otherwise "All Departments"
- **Manager/Employee Users**: Automatically restricted to their own department
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same logic applied across Dashboard, Project Tracker, and Task Tracker

### **2. Dynamic Department Dropdowns**
- **API Integration**: Fetch departments from `/api/dashboard/departments` endpoint
- **Admin Only**: Department dropdowns only visible to admin users
- **Real-time Updates**: Departments loaded dynamically from backend

### **3. Team Members Filtering**
- **Dashboard**: Team members now filtered by selected department
- **Dynamic Headers**: Team section headers show department name when filtered
- **Admin Control**: Admin can view team members from any department

### **4. Enhanced UI Indicators**

- **User Information**: Display current user's role and department
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of active filters
