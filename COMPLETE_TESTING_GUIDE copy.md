## 🐛 **Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

### **Issue: "JWT malformed"**
**Solution:** Ensure token is in format: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

### **Issue: "category_id is required"**
**Solution:** Include `category_id` in request body

### **Issue: "Invalid category_id"**
**Solution:** Use valid MongoDB ObjectId (24 hex characters)

### **Issue: "Permission denied"**
**Solution:** Check user role - only admin/brand_admin can create brands

### **Issue: "Categories not created"**
**Solution:** Check server logs - categories should auto-create when project is created
